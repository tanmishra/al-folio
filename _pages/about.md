Hey there! I'm Tanmay, a Research Associate stationed at the [University of Vermont, USA](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe). Here, I am working with fabulous energy system team lead by Professors [Mads](https://madsalma.github.io), [Amrit](https://www.amrit-pandey.com) and [Sam](https://samchevalier.github.io) on DOE funded Hybrid Energy System (HES) Project. This project aims to analyze HES comprehensively, addressing operational and planning challenges. Outcomes include advanced modeling (electro-thermal) tools, hardware validation via HIL platform, and field testing at the Hybrid Solar Test Center in Vermont.

Back in the day, I tinkered away at my PhD in Power Systems at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India](https://ee.iisc.ac.in) with Professor [Gurunath](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/~gurunath/). My [dissertation](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=UcwnoysAAAAJ&citation_for_view=UcwnoysAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC) was about a non-linear dynamic inversion algorithm to emulate a complete generating plant along with its controls (including a generalized turbine-governor and excitation system model), in the laboratory using a 5kVA micro-alternator. 

Now, rewind a bit further—I honed my craft with a Masters in Control Systems at [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/Electrical/about/) (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering) working on vector control of induction motor. And before that? a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [NIT Hamirpur](https://nith.ac.in/electrical-engineering).

Between tinkering with power and energy prelated roblems, you might catch me indulging in some podcasts or losing myself in the cinematic brilliance (Yes, I can quote it movies!). Books? Well, they entered my life fashionably late, but I'm kind of page-turner now. I've had a go at Cricket, Badminton, and Chess – a little taste of sporting variety. When life feels too chaotic, I seek refuge in the simple pleasures – the serenity of travel, the beauty of nature, and the comforting warmth of a cup of chai (or a soothing hot chocolate, depending on the mood and weather).
